        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large
            volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water</p>
        <p>
            Earth has been called the "Goldilocks planet." In the story of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," a little
            girl named Goldilocks liked everything just right. Her porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold. And her bed
            couldn't be too hard or too soft. On Earth, everything is just right for life to exist. It's warm, but not
            too warm. And it has water, but not too much water

        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>
            Mars is a planet. It is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is the next planet beyond Earth. Mars is more
            than 142 million miles from the Sun. The planet is about half the size of Earth. A day on Mars is 24.6
            hours. A year on Mars is 687 Earth days. Mars is known as the Red Planet. It is red because the soil looks
            like rusty iron. Mars has two small moons. Their names are Phobos (FOE-bohs) and Deimos (DEE-mohs).
        </p>
        <p>
            Mars is rocky with canyons, volcanoes and craters all over it. Red dust covers almost all of Mars. It has
            clouds and wind, just as Earth does. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. Tiny dust
            storms can look like tornados, and large ones can cover the whole planet! Mars has about one-third the
            gravity of Earth. A rock dropped on Mars would fall slower than a rock dropped on Earth. Things weigh less
            on Mars than they weigh on Earth.

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>

            Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It is approximately 143,000 kilometers (about 89,000
            miles) wide at its equator. Jupiter is so large that all of the other planets in the solar system could fit
            inside it. More than 1,300 Earths would fit inside Jupiter.

        </p>
        <p>


            Jupiter is like a star in composition. If Jupiter had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become
            a star rather than a planet.

            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun. Jupiter's average distance from the sun is 5.2 astronomical units,
            or AU. This distance is a little more than five times the distance from Earth to the sun. When viewed from
            Earth, Jupiter is usually the second brightest planet in the night sky, after Venus. The planet is named
            after Jupiter, the king of the Roman gods in mythology.
